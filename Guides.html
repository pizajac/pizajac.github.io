		<h1>Guides and general tips</h1>
        <p>If you find yourself in need of guidance, here are some tips I can give you from my own experience. Below them you'll also find guides made by experts.</p>
        <p><b>Disclaimer: The guides are not my intellectual property; they are material which I have used to learn the ins and outs of Blender and material which I can wholeheartedly recommend.</b></p>
        <h2>Tips from my experience</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Render your animation as separate frames. If one frame gets corrupter, Blender will render it again. If you rendered your animation as a whole video - the entire video will be lost.</li>
            <li>Pay close attention to the location of your objects - Blender will not correct the coordinates automatically. A great example of this is an oversight of my own; the coffee cup in the animation I made and embeded on the <b>3D animating</b> page is visibly floating.</li>
            <li>Work in Blender can be very frustrating. Sometimes things will not work as you want them to and in order to get the results you want you will need to change your approach or even the tools you use entirely. Don't be afraid to take a break.</li>
            <li>Remember that Blender has a built-in tool for compiling individual frames of your animation into a video and that all of Blender's tools and resources are free.</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid of looking for outside resources on the Internet. For example you may find some very useful textures, however keep in mind that outside resources may be acquirable only through a fee.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Guides</h3>
        <p>Here is a beginner's guide for Blender by Andrew Price, also known as Blender Guru. If you are interested in more, his channel is also linked below with many kinds of other videos about Blender (mostly different guides).</p>
