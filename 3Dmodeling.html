      <h1>The main use of Blender; 3D modeling</h1>
      <p>3D-modeling, alongside 3D animating, is the main function of Blender. Despite them both being the main functions of Blender, you must first learn at least the basics of 3D-modeling before you can proceed to animating.</p>
      <h2>What IS 3D modeling, exactly?</h2>
      <p>The Wikipedia definition of 3D modeling is as follows:</p>
      <p>"3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical coordinate-based representation of any surface of an object (inanimate or living) in three dimensions via specialized software."</p>
      <p>Sounds complicated, does it not? Though it may sound complicated, in reality, 3D modeling software has come a long way and it's been a long time since you last needed to input mathematical calculations to define an object.</p>
      <p>The user has access to an array of tools, many of which are separated depending on how they interact with objects and are available in different Object Modes. The Object Modes of Blender are:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Object Mode - allows you to see objects whole with filters which you applied to them and interact with them in a limited way.</li>
        <li>Edit Mode - allows you to alter the shape of the object by manipulating its vertexes, edges and faces.</li>
        <li>Sculpt Mode - allows you to alter the shape of an object through the use of the Brush; rather than manipulating individual entities mentioned above, the Brush manipulates the geometry of an area.</li>
        <li>Vertex Paint Mode - allows you to color vertexes.</li>
        <li>Weight Paint Mode - allows you to "paint weight" onto an area. You paint the area with the Brush in order to add weight; keep brushing over one area in order to add more weight.</li>
        <li>Texture Paint Mode - a mesh-only mode which allows you to paint your mesh's texture directly on the model.</li>
        <li>Particle Edit Mode - a mesh-only mode useful for configurable particle systems, used to create realistic hair.</li>
        <li>Pose Mode - an armature only mode dedicated to armature posing.</li>
        <li>Paint Mode - a Grease Pencil only mode, dedicated to Grease Pencil strokes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><center>Modeling made easy</center></h3>
      <p><center>Using different Modes you have the perfect tools to create just the model you wanted; Blender is used commonly both hobbystically and profesionally. How you're gonna use Blender - is up to you!</center></p>
